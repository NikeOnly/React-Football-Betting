Football Betting
----------------------------------------------

UI part for the Football Betting project.

Also added mock server for integration with API.
It has a good timing delay for the API requests to show te corner cases.

###To launch project you need:
1. Build UI part of the project (production / development version)

2. Put the 'target' content to your server or launch mocked
   API and enter 'localhost:3000' in your browser

####To build UI project you need to execute in terminal (or command prompt):
#####Production version:
```
    npm install
    npm run build
```
#####Development version (with watcher):
```
    npm install
    npm run watch
```

####To launch mocked server you need to execute in **new** terminal (or command prompt):
```
    cd mock-server-api
    npm install
    npm run start
```
